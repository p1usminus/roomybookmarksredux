Please read the tips.

## Tips ##
* Browser & version compatibility
  * Firefox 129+: [latest version](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/latest)
  * Firefox 113-128 and Waterfox G6.0+: [v1.7.7.7](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/tag/v1.7.7.7)
  * Firefox 108-112: [v1.7.6.1](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/tag/v1.7.6.1)
  * Firefox 78-107 and Waterfox G4.0.3.1+: [v1.7.5.3](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/tag/v1.7.5.3)
  * Waterfox G3: [v1.7.0.1](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/tag/v1.7.0.1)
  * Waterfox Current (based on Firefox 68): [v1.5.5.1](https://github.com/p1usminus/roomybookmarksredux/releases/tag/v1.5.5.1)
  * Waterfox Classic: [v1.4.17/original](https://web.archive.org/web/20191029180906/https://legacycollector.org/firefox-addons/210846/roomy-bookmarks-toolbar-1.4.17.xpi) (pls update)
  * Pale Moon: Try [Cozy Bookmarks Toolbar](https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/cozy-bookmarks-toolbar/)
* The fixed height option should be used when the multirow option is selected, otherwise the toolbar will try to stay at single row height.
* The toolbar behaves strangely when using the multirow option with a non-standard favicon size. Solution: Use the option to fix incorrect height ~~__with__ a non-zero margin size (see 2nd option tab). I wish this was less complicated.~~

## Other notes ##
* Looking for multiple tab rows? Check out [Paxmod](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod) or [Merci chao's userChrome script](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/blob/main/MultiTabRows%40Merci.chao.uc.js)
* :question: I would like to know if users prefer having the option to scroll when using the multirow option. It can be avoided using a combination of the multirow and margin options as above.
  * The single row multirow toolbar is neat.
* I repurposed one of the prefs to change the top & bottom margin of bookmark items. Adding new prefs looks like it could be annoying, but there may be a couple of other ones that could be re-used.
* Please highlight any issues you find, but I honestly don't know if I will be able to fix them! I uploaded everything here in the hopes that even if I cannot do anything more, perhaps someone else can...
	* CSS fixes are always welcome.

  <p>Thank you to Someone free, xiaoxiaoflood, 117649, Alex and the Thunderbird team! :clap:</p>
  <p>I only really use the autohide feature of Roomy, but after getting that to work again I thought it would be fun to get the rest of the features of this extension working again. It was, mostly.</p>
